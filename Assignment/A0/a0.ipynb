    "The coach wants you to develop a random roster generator that operates in a fair way.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Data scientists in 2012 are akin to the Wall Street “quants” of the 1980s and 1990s. With the development of big data, many companies are struggling with the amounts and types of data. Therefore, the demand for data scientists far exceeds the supply. Data scientists can find convincing patterns in the data and make informed decisions about products, processes and Advice to executives on the impact of decisions. They can find the core of the problem and devise creative ways to solve them.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. What recent developments and/or challenges it is facing now?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This field will grow faster than almost any other field. However, it faces more and more challenges. The challenges of managing ever-increasing data systems and technologies have resulted in a more complex technological environment, as the technology on which the field depends has advanced so much. In the same time, the importance of non-technical expertise (such as ethics and change management) has grown, and finally The growth of related roles has also created challenges for the field.\n",
    "3. How a Data Science role is now different from what it was perceived to be in 2012?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Data science has become more institutionalized, its scope has been redefined, the technologies it relies on have advanced, and the importance of non-technical expertise has grown. The role of data science is now complemented by a variety of other jobs as well, in 2012 data scientists were assumed to be able to perform all the required tasks, however now there is a surge in related jobs handling many of these tasks, in part due to the No single job role can hold all the skills needed to successfully deploy complex AI or analytics systems. At the same time, the techniques used by data scientists are changing. Some technology trends are a continuation of directions that emerged in 2012, such as the use of open source tools and the move to cloud-based processing and data storage. Finally, the ethical dimension also has an important impact on data science. More and more regulations are being created to deal with ethical lapses.\n",
